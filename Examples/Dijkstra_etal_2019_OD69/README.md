# iFlow version
Originally developed with iFlow version 2.7. Updated for iFlow v3.x.

# Input files  
Input files for basic cases without and with dumping (scheldt_2010, scheldt_2010_nodumping) - Figures 6, 7 8
Input file for sensitivity study for ws and M (scheldt_2010_wsM) - Figure 9
Input file for sensitivity study for deepening (scheldt_alpha_dc) - Figure 12

# Errors
* Accedentally used a value for z0* of 0.0007 instead of 0.0005 in fig 12a and 12b (in all but the 1960 line in 12a). Other results (also for fig 13) use z0*=0.0005.
